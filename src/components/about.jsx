                I’m a senior computer engineering student based in Istanbul, passionate about crafting meaningful digital experiences and solving complex problems. I believe challenges are opportunities to learn and grow — as the saying goes, ‘Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.’ While I have experience with modern web technologies, I see myself as a lifelong learner, always eager to grow and improve through new challenges. My aspiration is to one day contribute to building impactful systems that make a meaningful difference.
